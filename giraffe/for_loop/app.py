#for loop structure

for letter in "Bomb Diggity":
    print(letter)
    
    
friends = ["Bobby", "Jim", "Rad"]
#It assigns the variable right in the for loop
for friend in friends:
    print(friend)
    
#It's actually kind of like a range loop in Go

#Loop through an array
for index in range(len(friends)):
    print(friends[index])
